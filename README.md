# MySports

 We have developed a social networking  application that is geared towards bringing N.B.A  fans together to watch live events featuring their favorite teams at various sporting venues.
 This user friendly application allows like-minded fans to gather at a central location instead of going to multiple websites to find out about news relating to their favorite team.
 After downloading all NPM Packages (NPM Install and Twitter) each user will be issued an  individual login through Google OAUTH to their personalised account. 
 All user data will be stored in a SQL database. Users can update their profile, delete their profile, and add or delete their team(s) of choice.
 A Google  map will feature all the venues in proximity that will be playing the game as well the user’s geolocation. 
 A live Twitter feed will feature latest news from the user’s favorite team. 
 Additionally there is an events section that will further enhance user experience by keeping fans up to date on the latest action relating to their team(s).
 We required the following API’s to make the website more dynamic, Twitter, Google maps and Google places. We utilized Node and Express servers and deploy through Heroku.
